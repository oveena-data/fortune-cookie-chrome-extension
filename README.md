# Fortune Cookie Chrome Extension

Just a simple and fun little Chrome extension generating some 12-hourly inspo from some of my all-time favourite legends, including **📖 Napoleon Hill**, **💻 Ada Lovelace**, **🏎️ Ayrton Senna**, **💸 Warren Buffet**, **📊 Cassie Kozyrkov**, and **⭐ Tate McRae**. 
Disclaimer: While I call it a "fortune cookie," it's really a daily inspirational quote generator, with a dash of fortune, because being inspired is the first step to getting lucky.
