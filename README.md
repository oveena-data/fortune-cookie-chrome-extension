# Fortune Cookie Chrome Extension

Just a simple, fun Chrome extension that low-key delivers some daily inspirational quotes from some of my favourite, famous souls, including **📖 Napoleon Hill**, **💻 Ada Lovelace**, **🏎️ Ayrton Senna**, **💸 Warren Buffet**, **📊 Cassie Kozyrkov**, and **⭐ Tate McRae**.
